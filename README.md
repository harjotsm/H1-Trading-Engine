# H1 Trading Engine

A minimalistic trading (matching) engine built from scratch in Rust.

## Overview

This project implements a custom order matching engine with support for:
- **Order Books** - Manages buy and sell orders for trading pairs
- **Market Orders** - Execute immediately at the best available price
- **Limit Orders** - Execute only at a specified price or better

## Purpose

Building a matching engine from the ground up to understand the core mechanics of how modern exchanges handle order execution and price discovery.

## Status

🚧 Work in progress
